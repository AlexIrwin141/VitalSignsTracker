Vital Signs Tracking CLI Application  

A command-line application for tracking daily vital signs such as blood pressure, pulse rate, weight, and temperature. This application allows users to record and view health metrics over time, with the option to add notes for each entry. It also provides visualizations for better analysis of health trends within a specified date range.  

I wrote this both as a way to help me learn python and also when I was discharged from hospital after a lengthy stay and major surgery I had to keep track of my vital signs each day and periodically report them.


Features  

Add New Entry: Enter vital signs for the day, including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), pulse rate, weight, temperature, and notes.
View Records: Display records within a user-specified date range, including any missing days.
Data Visualization: Generate a plot of selected vital signs over a date range for easy analysis.
CSV Storage: All records are saved to a CSV file, allowing for simple data storage and retrieval.
